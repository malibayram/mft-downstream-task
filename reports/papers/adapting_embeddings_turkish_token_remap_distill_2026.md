# Adapting Pretrained Embedding Models to Turkish via Token Remapping and Distillation (Bayram, 2026) — Notes

Source: `papers/Adapting Pretrained Embedding Models to Turkish via Token Remapping and Distillation.pdf`

## What it is
Presents a Turkish-focused sentence embedding model (embeddingmagibu) and an efficiency-oriented adaptation pipeline:
1) Train a Turkish SentencePiece/BPE tokenizer (large vocab).
2) Clone a teacher embedding model by mapping new tokens to teacher-token sequences and initializing embeddings by composition.
3) Train with offline teacher-embedding alignment (cosine objective) to avoid online teacher inference.

## Key points relevant to our paper
- Strong motivation that tokenizer choice and vocabulary adaptation matter for Turkish embedding quality.
- Reports STS and TR-MTEB style evaluations and emphasizes practical, reproducible tooling for Turkish embedding models.

## How it relates to our work
- Supports the downstream-evaluation framing: morphology/segmentation choices should be validated with real tasks (STS/retrieval benchmarks), not only token purity.
- Provides a complementary perspective: tokenizer adaptation via token remapping vs our morphology-first tokenization pipeline.
