# Towards Better Tokenization for NLP: A Linguistically-Informed Hybrid Approach

This repository contains the research paper and associated materials for our work on developing a linguistically-informed hybrid tokenization framework for Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## 📋 Project Overview

This research presents a novel tokenization framework that combines rule-based morphological analysis with subword segmentation to improve token representation in NLP systems. The approach is particularly focused on handling morphologically rich languages, using Turkish as a case study.

## 🔑 Key Features

- Linguistically-informed hybrid tokenization framework
- Integration of rule-based morphological analysis with subword segmentation
- Phonological normalization
- Root-affix dictionary implementation
- Semantic grouping of functionally equivalent affixes
- Novel case-handling mechanism
- Language-independent design (demonstrated with Turkish)
